        specializing in user interfaces and static pages built with React. I
        write a lot of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, and love that I get to work
        with amazing artists and talented devs every day delivering a product
        that brings people joy.

        Before becoming a developer, I was a{' '}

        librarian for four years after earning a Master's in Library and
        Information Science from SJSU. Many people aren't sure what a librarian
        does; basically, we find, curate, and organize information for people in
        a systematic way.

        My love for problem solving, data management, and organization led me to

        coding. To grow my skills, I quit my library job to learn to code
        full-time. In March 2020, I obtained a Full-Stack Coding Certificate

        Besides coding, I spend my time reading, practicing yoga, and hanging

        the circus.
